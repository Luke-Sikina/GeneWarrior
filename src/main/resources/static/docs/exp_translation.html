<h1>What is Translation?</h1>
<p>See also <a href="tut_translation.html">how to translate DNA to protein</a>.</p>
Translation is the process where ribosomes create proteins by decoding nucleotide sequences. A single amino acid is
encoded by three nucleotides (<i>codon</i>). The translation step from codon to amino acid (which codon encodes which
amino acid) is determined by the <i>genetic code</i> (or <i>translation table</i>) that may slightly differ among
different species.<br>
Every nucleotide sequence can be translated in three different ways, depending on the starting position.<br>
The first codon of the sequence <code>GGGTTT</code> can either be <code>GGG</code>, <code>GGT</code> or <code>GTT</code>,
depending on whether the codon starts on position 1,2 or 3. These are called the three <i>reading frames</i>, and they
result in three distinctly different protein sequences.<br>

Translation starts with a specific initiation codon, commonly <code>AUG</code> (the <i>start codon</i>). Furthermore,
translation is terminated by a <i>stop codon</i>.

<h2>Genetic Code (or Translation Table)</h2>
The genetic code is a set of rules on how a codon (three nucleotides) is translated to an amino acid. The default is the
Standard code, which almost universal.<br>
The genetic code can be depicted as a Codon Wheel (from <a
        href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Codons_aminoacids_table.png" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>):<br>

The inner circle depicts the first nucleotide in the codon, the second ring the second nucleotide and the outermost ring
the third nucleotide. U stands for Uridine, which is interchangeable with T (Thymidine).
<p>However, depending on the phylogenetic clade there are some differences in the code, which mostly apply to start and
    stop codons.<br>
    For example, in the Genetic Code of the Mitochondrion, the <code>TGA</code>-codon encodes a tryptophan (W) instead
    of the stop codon in the standard genetic code.<br>

<h2>Open reading frames (ORF)</h2>
An ORF is a DNA sequence which starts with a start codon and is not interrupted by stop codon until the last codon. An
ORF is thus a candidate for a protein encoding gene.
