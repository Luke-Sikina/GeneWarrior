<h2>Marking and Annotating a Sequence</h2>

Highlight part of your sequence by coloring it or annotate it using directed arrows. The color will be kept for certain
actions such as reverse complement and translation.
<p>
    <b>Color or annotate</b><br>
    Select the desired part of the sequence by dragging your mouse.<br>

    The selected sequence can now be colored by clicking on the colored boxes.<br>
    To annotate the selected sequence, enter the annotation text into the text field and choose the desired arrow
    type.<br>
    An example of a marked sequence looks as follows:<br>

    or "<i>Remove annotation</i>".
