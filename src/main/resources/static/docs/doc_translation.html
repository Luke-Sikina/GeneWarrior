<h2>Translation</h2>
<p>See also <a href="exp_translation.html">What is Translation?</a> and <a href="tut_translation.html">How to translate
    your DNA sequence into a protein sequence</a>.</p>
This command is only valid for DNA sequences.

<p>The standard genetic code is set as default. Should you require a different genetic code, select it in the drop down
    table. See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi" target="_blank">here</a> for more
    information about the different genetic codes.</p>
<p><b>Show all frames</b><br>
    Select a single DNA sequence (this action can only be performed for one sequence at a time) and click on the "<i>Show
        all frames</i>". A new window opens, which displays the DNA sequence followed by all three forward reading
    frames. Start codons are marked in green, stop codons in red. By clicking on a codon you can select the beginning of
    a protein sequence, a subsequent click on a codon in the same frame selects the end. By clicking the button 'Export
    selected', the selected protein sequence is added to your project.<br>
    You can Shift-Click on a codon to automatically extend the selection to the corresponding open reading frame (ORF;
    the most upstream start codon and the next downstream stop codon).
</p>
<p><b>Translate directly</b><br>
    This option let's you directly translate one or multiple nucleotide sequences, without choosing an exact beginning
    and end codon. Select one or more DNA sequences and choose the reading frame to translate the chosen DNA sequences
    in full length. Stop codons are displayed as asterisks (*).<br>
    Reverse reading frames uses the reverse complement of the chosen sequence. This is the same action as clicking the
    reverse complement action followed by translating the resulting sequence using a forward reading frame.</p>
<p><b>Best guess</b><br>
    This option translates one or multiple nucleotide sequences by automatically choosing the longest possible open
    reading frame (ORF) in all three forward and all three reverse frames.
