<h2>How to create a Reverse Complement Sequence</h2>
<p>See also <a href="exp_revcomp.html">What is a reverse complement sequence?</a></p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Enter your DNA sequence into the text box and click the button "<i>Add</i>". Your new entry is added.<br>
        <img alt="Enter your DNA sequence" src="pics/tut_revcomp_1.png"><br>
        You can enter all sequences you need to convert at this point. If you don't have any sequences and just want to
        try it out, you can import some example sequences by clicking on "<i>Load Examples</i>", next to the "<i>Add</i>"-Button.<br>
        <small>For more details regarding data entry and acceptable formats see <a href="doc_sequenceimport.html">Help>Sequence
            Import</a></small>
    </li>
    <li>Select all your entries that you want to convert by clicking on them. Selected entries change the background
        color.<br>
        <img alt="Your DNA sequence is added to your project. Select the sequence by clicking on it"
             src="pics/tut_revcomp_2.png"><br>
        To deselect an entry, click on it again; the background changes to white again. You can select multiple entries
        to convert them all at once.<br>
        <small>For more details about selecting entries see <a href="doc_selecting.html">Help>Selecting entries</a><br>
            <a href="doc_rename.html">Help>Renaming entries</a> describes how to change an entry name.</small>

    </li>
    <li>After selecting the entries, choose the appropriate command in the tool bar: "<i>Reverse Complement > Reverse
        Complement</i>".<br>
        <img alt="Reverse complement sequence tool" src="pics/tut_revcomp_3.png"><br>
        The reverse complement gets inserted as a new entry, with the tag [RevComp] added to its name.<br>
        <img alt="Reverse complement sequence from your original sequence" src="pics/tut_revcomp_4.png"><br>
    </li>
</ol>

The same workflow can be used to generate reverse sequences and complement sequences.<br>
